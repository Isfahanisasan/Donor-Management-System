# Donor Management System


## Project Overview
This Donor Management System is a C++ program designed to manage donor information for a nonprofit organization. It allows users to add, delete, and retrieve donor information, as well as perform various operations like calculating total donations and finding the highest donation. The project was completed on November 21, 2021.

## Project Features
Donor Information Management: The system can store donor information, including first name, last name, membership number, and donation amount. The project involved two distinct implementations:


1- Doubly-Linked List (DLL) Version:

Created the initial version of the Donor Management System using DLL for modular code organization.
Designed core functionality for adding, deleting, and retrieving donor data.
Calculated and displayed total donations and identified the highest donation.
Implemented a user-friendly interface for streamlined user interaction.

2- Standard Template Library (STL) Enhanced Version:

Enhanced the DLL-based Donor Management System by incorporating the Standard Template Library (STL) for additional features and improved data handling.
Extended functionality to include advanced features like searching by membership number and comprehensive data display.

Demonstrated expertise in C++ programming, object-oriented design, and leveraging the STL for efficient data management.
Completed the STL-enhanced version as an advanced iteration of the original project.

## How to Run the Program
To run the Donor Management System, follow these steps:

1- Compile the source code files (DonorList.cpp, DonorType.cpp, MemberType.cpp, Interface.cpp, InputHandler.cpp, and Main.cpp) using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

2- Ensure you have an input file named "donors_data.txt" containing donor information in the format: 
First_Name, Last_Name, Membership_Number, Donation_Amount.

3- Execute the compiled program.
